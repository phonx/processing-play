Kotlin is a jvm that is similar Groovy, clojure, Jruby that is ran on top of Java.

Google has officially endorsed as a new lanuguage for Mobile development!

I find Kotlin easy to use but has some terse syntax that I find very annoying; as I get use to it - should make more comfortable with the language.
